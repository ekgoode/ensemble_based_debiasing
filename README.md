# Ensemble Based Debiasing
This project is an effort to synthesize the "competency" problems framework with ensemble-based debiasing methods.

Here's the current to-do list:
1. Train an ELECTRA-small model (Clark et al. 2020) on the Stanford NLI dataset (Bowman et. al. 2015).
2. Replicate figure 1 and table 1 from Gardner et al. 2021 using the ELECTRA-small model on the SNLI dataset.
3. Implement DRiFt (Debias by Residual Fitting) from He et al. 2019
4. If time allows implement ensemble-based method from Clark et al. 2019

Once those steps are complete, we can start writing.
